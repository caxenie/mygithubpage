Here's a CV for more details.\r\n\r\nAfter following a robotics and control engineering track during my undergraduate studies, I have switched my focus towards intelligent, brain-inspired processing algorithms.\r\nIn 2011 I have joined the [Neuroscientific System Theory Group](www.nst.ei.tum.de) lead by Prof. Conradt. This group's research direction is to understand information processing in neural systems, develop novel algorithms inspired by brain functionality and to transfer these into technical systems.\r\n\r\n## **Research**\r\n***\r\n\r\n### Synthesis of Distributed Cognitive Systems - Learning and Development of Multisensory Integration\r\n\r\n\r\nMy research interest is in developing sensor fusion mechanisms for robotic applications. In order to extend the interacting areas framework a second direction in my researcgh focuses on learning and development mechanisms.\r\n\r\nHuman perception improves through exposure to the environment. A wealth of sensory streams which provide a rich experience continuously refine the internal representations of the environment and own state. Furthermore, these representations determine more precise motor planning.\r\n\r\nAn essential component in motor planning and navigation, in both real and artificial systems, is egomotion estimation. Given the multimodal nature of the sensory cues, learning crossmodal correlations improves the precision and flexibility of motion estimates.\r\n\r\nDuring development, the biological nervous system must constantly combine various sources of information and moreover track and anticipate changes in one or more of the cues. Furthermore, the adaptive development of the functional organisation of the cortical areas seems to depend strongly on the available sensory inputs, which gradually sharpen their response, given the constraints imposed by the cross-sensory relations.\r\n\r\nLearning processes which take place during the development\r\nof a biological nervous system enable it to extract mappings between external stimuli and its internal state. Precise egomotion estimation is essential to keep these external and internal cues coherent given the rich multisensory environment. In this work we present a learning model which, given various sensory inputs, converges to a state providing a coherent representation of the sensory space and the cross-sensory relations.\r\n\r\nThe model is based on Self-Organizing-Maps and Hebbian learning (see Figure 1) using sparse population coded representations of sensory data. The SOM is used to represent the sensory data, while the Hebbian linkage extracts the coactivation pattern given the input modalitites eliciting peaks of activity in the neural populations. The model was able to learn the intrinsic sensory data statistics without any prior knowledge (see Figure 2).\r\n\r\nThe developed model, implemented for 3D egomotion estimation on a quadrotor, provides precise estimates for roll, pitch and yaw angles (setup depicted in Figure 3a, b).\r\n\r\nGiven relatively complex and multimodal scenarios in which robotic systems operate, with noisy and partially observable environment features, the capability to precisely and timely extract estimates of egomotion critically influences the set of possible actions.\r\n\r\nUtilising simple and computationally effective mechanisms, the proposed model is able to learn the intrinsic correlational structure of sensory data and provide more precise estimates of egomotion (see Figure 4a, b).\r\n\r\nMoreover, by learning the sensory data statistics and distribution, the model is able to judiciously allocate resources for efficient representation and computation without any prior assumptions and simplifications. Alleviating the need for tedious design and parametrisation, it provides a flexible and robust approach to multisensory fusion, making it a promising candidate for robotic applications.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Publications\r\n### Peer reviewed conference papers\r\n\r\nC.

These mechanisms enable a robot to obtain a consistent and global percept of its environment using available sensors by learning correlations between them in a distributed processing scheme inspired by cortical mechanisms.\r\n\r\nEnvironmental interaction is a significant aspect in the life of every physical entity, which allows the updating of its internal state and acquiring new behaviors. Such interaction is performed by repeated iterations of a perception-cognition-action cycle, in which the entity acquires and memorizes relevant information from the noisily and partially observable environment, to develop a set of applicable behaviors (see Figure 5). This recently started research project is in the area of mobile robotics; and more specifically in explicit methods applicable for acquiring and maintaining such environmental representations. State-of-the-art implementations build upon probabilistic reasoning algorithms, which typically aim at optimal solutions with the cost of high processing requirements.\r\n\r\nIn this project I am developing an alternative, neurobiologically inspired method for real-time interpretation of sensory stimuli in mobile robotic systems: a distributed networked system with inter-merged information storage and processing that allows efficient parallel reasoning. This networked architecture will be comprised of interconnected heterogeneous software units, each encoding a different feature about the state of the environment that is represented by a local representation (see Figure 6). Such extracted pieces of environmental knowledge interact by mutual influence to ensure overall system coherence. A sample instantiation of the developed system focuses on mobile robot heading estimation (see Figure 7). In order to obtain a robust and unambiguous description of robot’s current orientation within its environment inertial, proprioceptive and visual cues are fused (see image). Given available sensory data, the network relaxes to a globally consistent estimate of the robot's heading angle and position.\r\n\r\n### Publications\r\n### Journal articles \r\n\r\nI. Susnea, C.

Hence, applications should timely deliver synchronized data-sets, minimize latency in their response and meet their performance specifications in the presence of disturbances. The fault tolerant behavior in mobile robots refers to the possibility to autonomously detect and identify faults as well as the capability to continue operating after a fault occurred. This work introduces a real-time distributed control application with fault tolerance capabilities for differential wheeled mobile robots (see Figure 8).\r\n\r\nFurthremore, the application was extended to introduce a novel implementation for limited sensor mobile robots environment mapping. The developed algorithm is a SLAM implementation. It uses real time data acquired from the sonar ring and uses this information to feed the mapping module for offline mapping (see Figure 9). The latter is running on top of the real time fault tolerant control application for mobile robot trajectory tracking operation (see Figures 10, 11). \r\n\r\nAlong the developed applciation, the mechanical design, electronics design and implementation were made as part of the BA and MA thesis projects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Publications\r\n\r\n### Peer reviewed conference papers \r\n\r\nAxenie Cristian, Stancu Alexandru, Zanoschi Aurelian, Pascalin Andrei, Perjeru Marius, Maftei Florentina, A Client-Server Based Real-Time Control Tool for Complex Distributed Systems, Proc. of 9th Real-Time Linux Workshop, Linz, Austria, November 2007 (PDF)\r\n\r\nCristian Axenie, “Mobile Robot Fault Tolerant Control.
